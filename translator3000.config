# Translator3000 Configuration File
# ===================================

# API Request Delay Settings
# ---------------------------
# Delay between translation requests in milliseconds
# This setting controls how fast the translator makes API calls to Google Translate.
#
# PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS (benchmarked with 5 test phrases):
#   - 1ms delay:  3.0 translations/sec (too aggressive, API throttling reduces performance)
#   - 5ms delay:  4.6 translations/sec (OPTIMAL - best performance without throttling)
#   - 10ms delay: 4.5 translations/sec (very good, slightly more conservative)
#   - 50ms delay: 3.7 translations/sec (old default, 25% slower than optimal)
#
# TRADE-OFFS:
#   Lower values = Faster translation, but risk of API rate limiting
#   Higher values = Slower translation, but more respectful to API servers
#
# RECOMMENDED VALUES:
#   - 5ms:    Optimal performance (recommended for most use cases)
#   - 10ms:   Good performance with extra safety margin
#   - 20-50ms: Conservative (use for very large batches or if experiencing issues)
#   - 100ms+:  Very conservative (only if you encounter persistent rate limiting)
#
# NOTE: Each translation request already takes 200-300ms to complete, so the delay
# is just a small additional pause between requests to be respectful to the API.

delay=5  # milliseconds - optimized for best performance (4.6 trans/sec)

# Retry Settings
# --------------
# Maximum number of retry attempts for failed translations
max_retries=3

# Base delay for exponential backoff in milliseconds
retry_base_delay=20

# Multithreading Settings
# -----------------------
# Default number of worker threads for CSV processing
csv_max_workers=6

# Default number of worker threads for XML processing
xml_max_workers=6

# Minimum number of rows/elements required to enable multithreading
multithreading_threshold=2

# Translation Service Settings
# ----------------------------
# Translation service preference order (comma-separated)
# Available services: deep_translator, googletrans, libretranslate
# Services are tried in order until one succeeds
# 
# PERFORMANCE COMPARISON:
#   - deep_translator:  ~4.6 translations/sec (fastest)
#   - googletrans:      ~4.0 translations/sec (good)  
#   - libretranslate:   ~1.0 translations/sec (slower, but privacy-friendly)
#
# RECOMMENDED ORDER: fast services first, privacy-focused services as fallback
translation_services=deep_translator,googletrans,libretranslate

# LibreTranslate API endpoint (change if using self-hosted instance)
libretranslate_url=https://libretranslate.com/translate

# LibreTranslate API key (optional - leave empty for public API)
# Get a key from https://libretranslate.com/ for higher rate limits
libretranslate_api_key=

# Performance Settings
# --------------------
# Progress reporting interval (report every N items processed)
progress_interval=10
